# Examination 2 - Configure Ansible

To make things as unsurprising and difficult as possible, we will all set up
the exact same Ansible configuration in a dedicated folder for this purpose.

Do not use the directory with the Vagrantfile (the `lab_environment` directory
if you are using this `git` repository).

Create a separate directory for this and the following examinations, and keep
the configuration there.

## Create ansible.cfg

Create a directory for Ansible in your home directory. You can call it
anything, as long as you remember what it is.

In our dedicated Ansible directory, create a file called `ansible.cfg`
(there is an example `ansible.cfg` in this same directory that you
 may copy).

Put the following content (only two lines) into this file:

    [defaults]
    host_key_checking = False
    inventory = hosts

Each row in this file either contains a section name within brackets.
`[defaults]` contain default values that are used if nothing more specific
is given.

`host_key_checking` is a mechanism by which `ssh(1)` checks that a hostname
has a given set of encryption keys given as an identoty. This is a security
mechanism used to avoid spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks out in the
real world. Here, we disable it, otherwise we'll go crazy every time we
destroy or create the Vagrant hosts with new keys.

The `inventory` is where Ansible finds its inventory if you don't say
anything else, and `hosts` is its value. In this context, `hosts` is a file
that need to contain something that can be parsed as an Ansible inventory.
The `hosts` file in the same directory should contain:

    [all:vars]
    ansible_user=deploy
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file=<path_to_the_deploy_key_created_previously>

    [db]
    <IP or name from the Vagrant database host>

    [web]
    <IP or name from the Vagrant webserver host>

Anything within square brackets '[' and ']' are section names. _all_ is a section
for things that apply to all VMs in this inventory. The section name ending in
'_:vars_' contain variable key/values. Almost every name except _all_ is a valid
name for any section name.

When you have created this file (with the proper values within `<` and `>` are
substituted for the actual values, you should be able to do

    $ ansible --list-hosts all
      hosts (2):
        dbserver
        webserver
    $ ansible -m ping all
    webserver | SUCCESS => {
        "ansible_facts": {
            "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3.12"
        },
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
    }
    dbserver | SUCCESS => {
        "ansible_facts": {
            "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3.12"
        },
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
    }

The actual values above may be different in your exact setup, but the `SUCCESS`
values should give an indication that Ansible is able to login to each host
via SSH.

### Troubleshooting

If you get a warning from Ansible that looks something like this

    [WARNING]: Platform linux on host dbserver is using the discovered Python interpreter at /usr/bin/python3.12, but
    future installation of another Python interpreter could change the meaning of that path. See
    https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.18/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information.

To disable the warning, you may follow the suggestion on the web page above, i.e. in the `ansible.cfg`:

    [defaults]
    ...
    interpreter_python = python3
    ...

This will set the interpreter statically to `python3` which should be available on most modern operating systems.

You can also set it to

    interpreter_python = auto_silent

to make ansible figure out which Python interpreter to use, but stop giving warnings about potential future
incompatibilities.

## QUESTION A

What happens if you run `ansible-inventory --list` in the directory you created above?

## QUESTION B

What happens if you run `ansible-inventory --graph` in the directory you created above?

## QUESTION C

In the `hosts` file, add a new host with the same hostname as the machine you're running
ansible on:

    [controller]
    <hostname_of_your_machine> ansible_connection=local

Now run:

    $ ansible -m ping all

Study the output of this command.

What does the `ansible_connection=local` part mean?
